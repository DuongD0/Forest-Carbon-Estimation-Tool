# üìê Calculating Area on a Map Using Colors

This guide explains how to measure the area of regions on a map based on color information ‚Äî useful for identifying vegetation, water bodies, or land types visually represented in raster or image maps.

## üß† Concept

Calculating area based on color involves detecting pixels (or regions) that fall within a specified color range, then translating those pixel counts into real-world area using a known map scale.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods

### 1. **Using GIS Software (QGIS, ArcGIS)**

A professional and precise method using Geographic Information Systems.

**Steps:**

1. Load your map (raster/image) into GIS software.
2. Use the **Classify** or **Reclassify** tool to isolate color ranges.
3. Convert the result into a polygon layer using **Raster to Polygon**.
4. Use the **Field Calculator** to compute area:
   - In QGIS: `$area` for square meters or `$area / 1e6` for square kilometers.

### 2. **Using Python + OpenCV**

A programmable way to detect colored regions and calculate area (see `main.py`)

> üîç Make sure to define an appropriate `scale_factor` based on your map resolution.

### 3. **Using Online Tools (ImageJ, Google Earth Pro)**

#### **ImageJ**

1. Open the map image.
2. Use **Color Threshold** to select the region.
3. Go to **Analyze ‚Üí Measure** to get the area.

#### **Google Earth Pro**

1. Use the **Polygon Tool** to draw around colored regions.
2. The **area measurement** appears in the polygon properties.

### 4. **Manual Estimation (Low-Tech Approach)**

Use for simple or printed maps.

**Steps:**

1. Overlay a transparent grid on the map.
2. Count grid squares that match the target color.
3. Multiply by the area per square.

> Example: 15 green squares √ó 1 km¬≤ each = 15 km¬≤

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Considerations

- **Map Scale:** You must know the pixel-to-distance or image scale (e.g., 1 pixel = 10 m).
- **Color Variations:** Use a range to accommodate gradients or shadows. HSV color space is often better than BGR for filtering.
- **Precision:** GIS and code-based methods are generally more accurate than manual methods.
